# char_name
Small program where the you are told how many characters are in your name.

I was learning Python and was given the homework idea of finding out the length of a string and was blown away by how simple it was to code in Python but also wanted to recreate it in C++.

I personally enjoy the complexity of C++ and will always do my best to utilize it how I see fit, but I am still shocked by Python non the less.
